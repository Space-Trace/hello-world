# hello-world
# This Repo is for learning and recording programs and programming in raw form, as in as I learn and grow in this process. 

# I have been dabbeling in coding in one form or another for about 3 and 1 half years now. Eventually I would like to write
# games and usefull applications and programs. The games part is for my Nieces and Nephews, the latter is for my self. 
# This Commit Message is forward thoughts to the future and a few reasons why I would like them to happen. 

# Cleaning up the Readme file. :) The first two lines are the inital Comments in this readme file. The next three lines 
# were for practice using the branching mechs, comits, and merging. 
# These last three lines is the clean up of the readme file, and also practice at using the branching mechs.
