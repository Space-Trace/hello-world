# hello-world
This Repo is for learning and recording programs and programming in raw form, as in as I learn and grow in this process. 
I have been dabbeling in coding in one form or another for about 3 and 1 half years now. Eventually I would like to write
games and usefull applications and programs. The games part is for my Nieces and Nephews, the latter is for my self. 

# This Commit Message is forward thoughts to the future and a few reasons why I would like them to happen.
